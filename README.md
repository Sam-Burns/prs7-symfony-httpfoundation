PSR-7 Compliant Adapters for Symfony HTTP Foundation
====================================================

Currently incomplete, so get involved with the development!

Fill in some of the methods in ```src/*.php``` if you're feeling helpful.  Behat tests are available if you want - edit
```src-dev/public/index.php``` and ```tests/behat/features/...``` if the idea appeals.  We also have a PHPSpec
installation and a PHPUnit installation if you wish to add tests there.

Tests can be run locally on PHP5.4+ with ```./tests/tests-dev.sh```, and will also run on Travis CI.

As this is a PSR-related project, PSR-2 is the preferred coding standard, but if you don't know how to do that, someone
will fix it for you.

Bug reports also welcomed.

Thanks for your help!
